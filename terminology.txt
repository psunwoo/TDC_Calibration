1. About CARRY
CARRY8: a unit in FPGA
carry_number: The number of the CARRY8 unit. e.g. [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] belongs to carry_num = 1 
start_num:starting carry_number from the tapped data
end_num:ending carry_number from the tapped data
carry_index: position of the bin in the CARRY8 cell

2. About POR
DAG: directed Acyclic Graph i.e. preceding relationships of bins
    DAG is deduced from the tapped data
POR: Partial Order Reconstruction
    Deduce, wherever possible from the DAG, the true sequence of the bins. 
    Need to base on an ansatz, at the starting guess (POR1), since the logical
    information is not enough.
Results of the POR are called as either:
  1) bin_assignment: in the format to be directly feedable to vivado.
  i.e. in the format of {logical bin number: physical bin number}
  e.g.
  {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4 .. }


  2) POR_result: in the format that shows the deduced bin sequence inside each CARRY8 cell
  e.g.
  [[(4, 8)], [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 5)], ...]

logical bin: assigned bin number
physical bin: original bin number (default value) which sequence is wrong

3. slicing CARRY
Bins from different CARRY8 cells are mixed up in the sequence, due to the time
difference between two consecutive CARRY8 cells not larger than the time variation
within a single cell.

Hence the list of CARRY8 cells are 'sliced' into 3 groups (i.e. 
only one in three is considered, they will all be 'glued' together
by the technique called Iterative Time-bin Interleaf (IIT))
